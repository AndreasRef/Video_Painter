A Processing sketch for painting with video

As a side project during the course Intro to Programming at CIID, I made a Processing sketch that enables anyone to “paint with video”.
The program is written from scratch with a lot of blood, sweat and object-oriented tears. 

I utilised the controlP5 library by Andreas Schlegel for the GUI, thus enabling the user to control the alpha, resolution and size of the brush.

In the future, I hope to move Video Painter beyond the screen and into the streets of cities, or to museums and galleries. Inquiries for collaboration are more than welcome.

This short video is made with help from danish director and cinematographer Torben Kjelstrup, who made his face, camera and talent available for me.
